    Get in touch

  <p>
    I can be found at the links below; feel free to send me a message on LinkedIn if you'd like to connect, or create an issue on one of my repos on GitHub if you find one. I also have <a href="https://codepen.io/arnest00" rel="noopener noreferrer">a CodePen profile</a> where I occasionally play around with new Pens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Otherwise, if you found a cool pixel art palette, want to talk about your calisthenics routine (that's "talk about" not "sell me"), or have any horror movie recommendations, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:osmond@osmondarnesto.com">osmond@osmondarnesto.com</a>.
